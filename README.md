# Digital-Image-Processing
This assignment took place in the course "Digital Image Processing" of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at 8th Semester. It contains two parts which described below.

## :ledger: Description 
### Part 1
This part implements the following:
1. Reconstruction of RGB image from Bayer pattern.
2. Downsampling of RGB image.
3. Quantization of RGB image.
4. PPM representation.

There are different demo scripts that present the results of the first part.
